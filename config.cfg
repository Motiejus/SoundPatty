Unlimited number of tresholds may be added
Buffer size: what size chunks should the system process (in seconds) (totally technical)
miwavefreq: Minimum frequency of a wave.
    When treshold.min > 0, then this option affects results. This value means
    how many dots (ex. are SAMPLE_RATE / second, e.g. 8000) to skip
    if they come out of the given treshold value. Number of "dots" is
    SAMPLERATE/minwavefreq
chunklen: what is the minimum length of an interesting "chunk" in seconds
maxsteps: maximum number of steps to "skip" when trying to find the value
matchme: after finding this number of steps we say "FOUND"
