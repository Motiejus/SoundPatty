In order to compile stand-alone Windows binary, you need to do the following:

1. Install mingw32

    sudo apt-get install mingw32

2. Acquire sox source and put it to "sox" subfolder. 

    git clone -b mingw4.2.1 git://github.com:Motiejus/sox.git

3. Run cmake to configure the project for cross-compilation:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./i586-mingw32msvc.cmake

4. make

It compiles SoX and SoundPatty. After that you have `src/soundpatty.exe`, which
you can run in Windows terminal.
